      <p>Charles Dickens was an English writer and critic. He has made some of the world most well known fictional characters (such as Oliver Twist, Ebenezer Scrooge and David Copperfield) and was refered to as a literary genius. He has written 15 novels but hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles. He truly showed the way of expressing stories through language.</p>
      <p>He was born on 7th of February, 1812 at Portsmouth. He was first educated at a dame school (a type of school usually with women and located at the home of the teacher.) and then at a school run by a dissenter. He had to leave school to go work in a factory after his father was incarcerated in a debtors' prison. This meant that he never got a proper education.</p>
      <p>Dickens' very first story was 'The Pickwark Papers', which is about 4 men going to explore remote areas and then report their finding to all of the others. This novel, although good, went by unnoticed. They books we know him for are 'A Christmas Carol', 'Great Expectations', 'David Copperfield' and 'Oliver Twist'.
