      <p>The Victorian Times were the times during which Queen Victoria reigned. During this time, thie population of England almost doubled, slavery was abolished and many scientific discoveries were made. The population of England grew from 16.8 mil to 30.5 mil. Likewise, Scotland's population grew from 2.8 mil to 4.4 mil. However, Ireland lost over half of their population due to emigration or the Great Famine.</p>
      <p>Social reforms to abolish slavery were made and slavery-like burdens on women and children were lifted to help the minorities. Some women were allowed to get jobs as actors in plays and performances. This made the Victorian Times a better place than previous eras for minorities to live in.</p>
      <p>However, there were many disadvantages to be living at this time. Giving birth to a child was potentialy life-threatening as there were no proper facilities for delivering children. The Church of England's principles was still being enforced upon people, and some people wanted slavery to come back.</p>
